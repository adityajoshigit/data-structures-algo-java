 * 
 * Given an array of integers of any size, nâ‰¥1, and a number m, develop an algorithm as
 * a pseudo code (not a program!) that would swap all numbers with value m with the
 * subsequent numbers. You must perform this operation in place i.e., without creating an
 * additional array and keeping number of operations as small as possible. For example,
 * given an array [5, 4, 6, 9, 6, 3, 6], and a number 6, the algorithm will return [5, 4, 9, 6,
 * 3, 6, 6]. Finally, your algorithm must not use any auxiliary/additional storage to
 * perform what is needed.
